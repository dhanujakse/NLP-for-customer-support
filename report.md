# Project Report â€“ NLP for Customer Support

## 1. Introduction
Customer support is crucial for user satisfaction, but manual ticket handling is slow. This project applies **NLP techniques** to automate query categorization and improve efficiency.

---

## 2. Objectives
- Preprocess and clean customer queries.
- Categorize support tickets into defined groups.
- Improve speed and accuracy of responses.

---

## 3. Methodology
### a) Preprocessing
- Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization
- Vectorization using TF-IDF

### b) Model Training
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- SVM

### c) Evaluation
- Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

---

## 4. Results
- Logistic Regression: ~90% accuracy
- Naive Bayes: Effective for short text
- SVM: Good accuracy but computationally heavy

---

## 5. Conclusion
NLP significantly enhances customer support by reducing manual intervention. Automated ticket classification leads to faster resolutions and improved customer satisfaction.

---

## 6. Future Enhancements
- Deep learning (BERT/Transformers) integration
- Deployment as a chatbot/web app
- Multi-language support
