# NLP for Customer Support

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to improve customer support systems by automatically classifying and categorizing support tickets.  
The goal is to minimize response time, reduce workload on agents, and enhance customer satisfaction.

---

## Features
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization).
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF**.
- Classification using machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**:
  - `nltk`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
- **Dataset**: Sample customer support ticket dataset given in the repo.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/NLP-for-Customer-Support.git
   cd NLP-for-Customer-Support
---

## ðŸ“Š Results
- Logistic Regression: ~90% accuracy
- Naive Bayes: Good for short queries
- SVM: High accuracy but slower training

---

## ðŸ”® Future Scope
- Deploy as a chatbot or API
- Use transformers (BERT/DistilBERT) for better accuracy
- Add multi-lingual support
